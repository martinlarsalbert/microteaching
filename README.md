# microteaching
A micro teaching session for the Chalmers course: GFOK020–TEACHING, LEARNING &amp; EVALUATION

## Presentation
You can launch the presentation by clickin on: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/martinlarsalbert/microteaching/HEAD?filepath=notebooks%2Fpresentation.ipynb)
(it will take some time to load).

## Task
Your task is to teach a 15-minute lesson on a topic from your own subject area and of your own choosing. Use these four questions to guide the design and delivery of your lesson:

1. What are the [objectives](docs/objectives.md) of my lesson?
2. How can I present the topic in a clear and [interesting](docs/interesting.md) way?
3. How can I [activate](docs/activate.md) my audience?
4. How will I know if they have [understood](docs/understood.md) what I have taught?

The lesson can be a section of a lecture, tutorial, lab introduction or similar. Please note that you don't need to give a presentation, but could also focus on leading your peers in an exercise.  What you do is up to you. However, section is a key word here, as we don’t want you to try to compress a longer lesson into 15 minutes, but that you plan something that you can realistically do within the given time. 15 minutes is not a long time!

## Active learning techniques:
* 5 min socializing prior to lecture (so that the students get to know each other)
* Ask questions continuesly not just at the very end (this calls for presentations also?)
