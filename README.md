# microteaching
A micro teaching session for the Chalmers course: GFOK020–TEACHING, LEARNING &amp; EVALUATION

## Task
Your task is to teach a 15-minute lesson on a topic from your own subject area and of your own choosing. Use these four questions to guide the design and delivery of your lesson:

1. What are the [objectives](docs/objectives.md) of my lesson?
2. How can I present the topic in a clear and **interesting** way?
3. How can I **activate** my audience?
4. How will I know if they have **understood** what I have taught?

The lesson can be a section of a lecture, tutorial, lab introduction or similar. Please note that you don't need to give a presentation, but could also focus on leading your peers in an exercise.  What you do is up to you. However, section is a key word here, as we don’t want you to try to compress a longer lesson into 15 minutes, but that you plan something that you can realistically do within the given time. 15 minutes is not a long time!
